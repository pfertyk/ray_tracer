# Ray Tracer
A simple program for generating 3D graphics using [ray tracing algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_%28graphics%29). Generated image can be saved as a PNG file. The program's implementation is based mostly on [this publication](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~shirley/books/fcg2/rt.pdf).

## Requirements
This program requires Python 3.x and PIL library.

## Quick start

## Tests
Several tests are provided for this program. Each test generates an image of a scene and compares it with an original image (stored in tests directory). If any differences are detected, generated image is saved to allow comparing it with original.

Please keep in mind that these tests run much longer than standard unit tests.

## Samples

Sample images below have been generated using 3 scenes from the Examples module.
